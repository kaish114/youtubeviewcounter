#Youtube View Updater / Comment Updater

##How to Use

###Step 1: 
Get setup with the Youtube API: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/python
        Be sure to follow it carefully, as it won't work if you don't do every step. \
\
###Step 2: Save the Google Oauth Client File from Step 1 into a file named "secret.json" \
###Step 3: [Download](https://github.com/nang149/youtubeviewcounter.git) code from Github and 
	- Replace client_secrets_file with your new "secret.json"
 	- Replace the id's with the id of the video you want to edit
###Step 4:
	Run the program (yt_view_counter.py for view counter, yt_comment_vid.py for comment updater) by using command
	```
	python yt_view_counter.py
	'''
###Step 5: The Youtube API will give you a link to get authenticated. Go to this link, and if you get "Website is not secure", just hit "Advanced" and keep going to get your authentication code.
###Step 6: It should work now!
